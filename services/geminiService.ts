 * ===============
 * All Gemini API calls have been moved to the backend server.
 * The API key is now secure and only accessible server-side.
 * 
 * Frontend should use: /services/triageClient.ts
 * Backend implementation: /server/services/geminiService.js
 * 
 * If you see an error about this file, it means the migration is incomplete.
 * Import triageClient.ts instead for all triage analysis.
 * 
 * @deprecated Use triageClient.analyzeTriageViaAPI() instead
